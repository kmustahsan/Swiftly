It really doesn't matter what the JSON looks like, so do something simple:

{"items": {
  "barcode": "3500074140",
  "name": "Colgate Toothpaste",
  "price": "10.00"
}}


When making the two screens (the recipt and shopping cart -- Kevin & Khoa) add the swipe gesture to and from your screen ( so swiping from the barcode screen to recipt and from the reciept to barcode screen). I insterted a comment to where you can find the barcode details.
